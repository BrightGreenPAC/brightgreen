Technology is changing every aspect of our lives. Used wisely, it can expand opportunity, strengthen democracy, and help solve pressing challenges. Used poorly, it can deepen inequities or erode trust. Bright Green supports approaches that put people first, balancing innovation with fairness and accountability.

## What we support
- Ethical standards for public data, AI, and digital services
- Tools that improve access to civic information and participation
- Investments in research, startups, and clean technologies that serve the public good
- Programs that ensure rural and underserved communities are not left behind
- Training and education programs that prepare people for jobs in emerging fields

## Why it matters
Innovation shapes the economy, politics, and daily life. With thoughtful guardrails, technology can make communities safer, more efficient, and more connected. Without them, risks grow faster than solutions.

## Our approach
We highlight candidates and measures that commit to responsible innovation: supporting transparency, public input, and measurable benefits. Technology should empower people, not overwhelm them, and it should always serve the long-term public interest.
