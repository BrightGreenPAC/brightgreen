Buildings are where people spend most of their time, and they drive a huge share of energy use and emissions. Green building practices save money over the long term, improve comfort and health, and make communities more resilient.

## What we support
- Energy-efficient construction and retrofits for homes, schools, and workplaces
- Use of clean materials with low toxicity and low embodied carbon
- Incentives for weatherization, insulation, and heat pump adoption
- Public building standards that set an example for sustainability
- [Add local/state-specific example here]

## Why it matters
Efficient, healthy buildings reduce monthly costs, improve indoor air, and cut climate pollution. They also strengthen local economies by creating steady, skilled jobs in construction, maintenance, and clean technology.

## Our approach
We highlight candidates and measures that make better buildings practical: clear standards, incentives that work for families and small businesses, and accountability for performance. Green building should be the norm, not the exceptionâ€”delivering savings and comfort for everyone.
