A healthy democracy needs fair rules and confident voters. Bright Green supports policies that make participation simple and secure, encourage issue-focused campaigns, and keep public trust at the center.

## What we support
- Convenient voting with clear, plain-language information
- Nonpartisan election administration and transparent audits
- Campaign finance reforms that increase disclosure and reduce undue influence
- Accessible tools like voter guides and debates that compare ideas, not insults
- [Add local/state-specific example here]

## Why it matters
When voters trust the process, they focus on solutions. Fair elections elevate candidates with practical plans, not just the loudest voices. That helps communities choose leaders who will deliver on the basics: safety, opportunity, and a resilient future.

## Our approach
We endorse candidates and measures that protect access, transparency, and accountability. We will amplify practical fixes—like better voter info, simpler ballots, and timely results communication—because a calm, clear process is good for everyone.
